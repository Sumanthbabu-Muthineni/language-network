                You should remember that you can be ANY age and start learning a
                new language! The idea
                <br /> that there’s a cut-off point for language acquisition is
                incredibly common. People think that unless you <br />
                learned a language when you were a child, there’s no hope and
                it’ll be near-impossible to grasp. <br /> <br />
                NEWSFLASH: That’s not the case! Learning French as an adult or
                young adult IS possible. You CAN <br />
                grasp a language, no matter your age. The difference between
                adults learning and children learning
                <br />
                is that children are pretty much fearless when it comes to
                making mistakes. Did you know that <br />
                language anxiety affects around a third of adult learners?
                Because many of us have this fear, there’s a<br /> risk we miss
                out on learning key French words and phrases.
                <br />
                <br /> So whether you’re 5 or 50, you can learn French easily by
                consistently practising! The best way to learn <br />
                French is to be mindful of the fact that languages are about
                more than just vocabulary and grammar.
                <br /> Languages like French are built around people, culture,
                and connection.
